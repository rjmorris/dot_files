# ~/.inputrc: Set readline variables and keybindings.
# Further settings may be found in /etc/inputrc.
# See man bash for details.


# --- Variables ---

# Issue `bind -V` at a bash prompt to see the current setting for all variables.

# Don't play a sound or flash the screen when completions aren't found, etc.
set bell-style none

# If the characters after the cursor match the completion, don't re-insert those
# characters. For example, suppose the current command is "ls d^ocu", where ^
# represents the position of cursor. Pressing Tab at this point would yield "ls
# documents/ocu" by default. With this setting, it would yield "ls documents/".
set skip-completed-text on


# --- Keybindings ---

# Issue `bind -P` at a bash prompt to see the current keybindings.

# by typing C-v and then the special key. Replace ^[ with \e.

#   "\e[A"  - up
#   "\e[B"  - down
#   "\e[C"  - right
#   "\e[D"  - left
#   "\e[5~" - page up

# Type a few characters, then use the up and down arrows to cycle through
# history commands that start with those letters.
