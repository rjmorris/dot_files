! Set the Caps Lock key to a Control key.
!
! NOTES:
!
!   1) This is currently configured in .xession with the command:
!        setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps
!      and has therefore been commented out of this file.
!
!   2) This can also be implemented by setting the "ctrl:nocaps" option
!      in the keyboard section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf. However, doing it
!      there makes it a global setting, while doing it here makes it a
!      user setting.
